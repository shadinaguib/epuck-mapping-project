# epuck-mapping-project

This project was done during the third year of the Micro Engineering Bachelor degree at EPFL. The goal is to program a robot based on the STM32 microcontroller with a real time OS and several sensors (TOF, camera, IR, etc.) and create an original project.

The robot first makes a map of the environment with a TOF sensor, and then visits the several obstacles and behaves differently depending on the color of the obstacle, as seen in the GIF below (watch mp4 video for sound).
